     * has asked for a random selection of MOST of the elements in the original list (for example,
     * choosing 9 elements out of a list of 10 elements). Once you get to a point where most
     * indices have already been selected, it takes an increasing number of random selections
     * to pick an index that has not already been included in the random choice. When choosing
     * the final element in the above example, eight of the ten indices will already have been
     * chosen, meaning the last choice requires (on average) 5 attempts to choose a valid
     * index. This can get much, much worse when the size of the array gets larger.
     *
     * To stave off this issue, this algorithm creates a list of indices that have not yet been
     * picked ONLY once we cross a specific threshold. This prevents us from creating a comically
     * large list of indices that haven't been selected when it doesn't save us much time.
     * However, once we cross that threshold, taking the effort to create a list of indices that
     * haven't been picked yet, then choosing at random from that list, saves a lot of time.

     *               list.size * (1 - threshold).
     * selectingFromNYP: a boolean dictating whether we are selecting indices from notYetPicked
     *                   or still picking indices at random in the range [0, list.size).
     * threshold: the point at which selectingFromNYP should become true and notYetPicked should
     *            be constructed. Note that this value is compared to `i / list.size` (i.e., we
     *            are dividing the current number of selected indices versus the total size of
     *            the list). If threshold = 0.8, and we are selecting 3 items from a list of 10,
